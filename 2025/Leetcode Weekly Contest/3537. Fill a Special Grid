You are given a non-negative integer n representing a 2n x 2n grid. You must fill the grid with integers from 0 to 22n - 1 to make it special. A grid is special if it satisfies all the following conditions:

All numbers in the top-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-right quadrant.
All numbers in the bottom-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-left quadrant.
All numbers in the bottom-left quadrant are smaller than those in the top-left quadrant.
Each of its quadrants is also a special grid.
Return the special 2n x 2n grid.

Note: Any 1x1 grid is special.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 0

Output: [[0]]

Explanation:

The only number that can be placed is 0, and there is only one possible position in the grid.

Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: [[3,0],[2,1]]

Explanation:

The numbers in each quadrant are:

Top-right: 0
Bottom-right: 1
Bottom-left: 2
Top-left: 3
Since 0 < 1 < 2 < 3, this satisfies the given constraints.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2

Output: [[15,12,3,0],[14,13,2,1],[11,8,7,4],[10,9,6,5]]

Explanation:



The numbers in each quadrant are:

Top-right: 3, 0, 2, 1
Bottom-right: 7, 4, 6, 5
Bottom-left: 11, 8, 10, 9
Top-left: 15, 12, 14, 13
max(3, 0, 2, 1) < min(7, 4, 6, 5)
max(7, 4, 6, 5) < min(11, 8, 10, 9)
max(11, 8, 10, 9) < min(15, 12, 14, 13)
This satisfies the first three requirements. Additionally, each quadrant is also a special grid. Thus, this is a special grid.

 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 10

Code:

class Solution {
    public int[][] specialGrid(int N) {
        int size = 1 << N; // 2^N
        return buildGrid(size, 0);
    }
    private int[][] buildGrid(int size, int start) {
        if (size == 1) {
            return new int[][]{{start}};
        }
        int half = size / 2;
        int squareSize = half * half;
        // Recursively build the smaller quadrant grid
        int[][] base = buildGrid(half, start);
        // Allocate full grid
        int[][] grid = new int[size][size];
        // Fill 4 quadrants with offsets
        for (int i = 0; i < half; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < half; j++) {
                grid[i][j + half] = base[i][j];                    // top-right (smallest)
                grid[i + half][j + half] = base[i][j] + squareSize;      // bottom-right
                grid[i + half][j] = base[i][j] + squareSize * 2;         // bottom-left
                grid[i][j] = base[i][j] + squareSize * 3;                // top-left (largest)
            }
        }

        return grid;
    }
}
