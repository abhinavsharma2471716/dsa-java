You are given an m x n integer matrix grid and an integer k.

For every contiguous k x k submatrix of grid, compute the minimum absolute difference between any two distinct values within that submatrix.

Return a 2D array ans of size (m - k + 1) x (n - k + 1), where ans[i][j] is the minimum absolute difference in the submatrix whose top-left corner is (i, j) in grid.

Note: If all elements in the submatrix have the same value, the answer will be 0.

A submatrix (x1, y1, x2, y2) is a matrix that is formed by choosing all cells matrix[x][y] where x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.
 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,8],[3,-2]], k = 2

Output: [[2]]

Explanation:

There is only one possible k x k submatrix: [[1, 8], [3, -2]].
Distinct values in the submatrix are [1, 8, 3, -2].
The minimum absolute difference in the submatrix is |1 - 3| = 2. Thus, the answer is [[2]].
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[3,-1]], k = 1

Output: [[0,0]]

Explanation:

Both k x k submatrix has only one distinct element.
Thus, the answer is [[0, 0]].
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,-2,3],[2,3,5]], k = 2

Output: [[1,2]]

Explanation:

There are two possible k × k submatrix:
Starting at (0, 0): [[1, -2], [2, 3]].
Distinct values in the submatrix are [1, -2, 2, 3].
The minimum absolute difference in the submatrix is |1 - 2| = 1.
Starting at (0, 1): [[-2, 3], [3, 5]].
Distinct values in the submatrix are [-2, 3, 5].
The minimum absolute difference in the submatrix is |3 - 5| = 2.
Thus, the answer is [[1, 2]].
 

Constraints:

1 <= m == grid.length <= 30
1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 30
-105 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
1 <= k <= min(m, n)

Code :

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[][] minAbsDiff(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] answer = new int[m - k + 1][n - k + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= m - k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n - k; j++) {
                
                TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
                
              
                for (int x = i; x < i + k; x++) {
                    for (int y = j; y < j + k; y++) {
                        set.add(grid[x][y]);
                    }
                }

              
                int minimumDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                Integer prev = null;
                for (Integer val : set) {
                    if (prev != null) {
                        minimumDiff = Math.min(minimumDiff, Math.abs(val - prev));
                    }
                    prev = val;
                }

                // If only 1 unique value, minimumDiff stays Integer.MAX_VALUE → meanswer 0 diff
                answer[i][j] = minimumDiff == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minimumDiff;
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
