Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 

Constraints:

0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

Code:

Approach 1 : //O(1)

class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int len = high - low + 1;
        if(low % 2 != 0 && high % 2 != 0){
            return len / 2 + 1;
        }else{
            return len / 2;
        }
    }
}

Approach 2: //O(1)


class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        return (high + 1) / 2 - (low / 2);
    }
}
