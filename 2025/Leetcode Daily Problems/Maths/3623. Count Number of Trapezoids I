You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the Cartesian plane.

A horizontal trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e. parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

Return the number of unique horizontal trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from points.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]

Output: 3

Explanation:



There are three distinct ways to pick four points that form a horizontal trapezoid:

Using points [1,0], [2,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
Using points [2,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
Using points [1,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

Output: 1

Explanation:



There is only one horizontal trapezoid that can be formed.

 

Constraints:

4 <= points.length <= 10^5
–108 <= xi, yi <= 10^8
All points are pairwise distinct.


Code: //O(n)

class Solution {
    public int countTrapezoids(int[][] points) {
        final long MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        // Count how many points lie on each horizontal y-level
        Map<Integer, Integer> countAtY = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] p : points) {
            int y = p[1];
            countAtY.put(y, countAtY.getOrDefault(y, 0) + 1);
        }
        long answer = 0;
        long totalPairsBefore = 0;  // sum of C(cnt[y],2) over previous y-levels
        // For each horizontal line
        for (int cnt : countAtY.values()) {
            // Number of ways to pick 2 points on this y-level (a horizontal segment)
            long pairsHere = (long) cnt * (cnt - 1) / 2;
            // Trapezoids formed with all previous levels:
            // each previous pairs * current pairs
            answer = (answer + pairsHere * totalPairsBefore) % MOD;
            // Add current pair count to running total
            totalPairsBefore = (totalPairsBefore + pairsHere) % MOD;
        }
        return (int) answer;
    }
