Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 10^5

Code: //O(k)

class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        // If divisible by 2 or 5, impossible to form with only 1s
        if (k % 2 == 0 || k % 5 == 0) return -1;

        int remainder = 0;
        int length = 0;

        // At most k iterations before remainder repeats
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k;
            length++;

            if (remainder == 0) return length;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
