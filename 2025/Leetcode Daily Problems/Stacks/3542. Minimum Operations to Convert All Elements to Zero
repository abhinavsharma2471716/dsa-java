You are given an array nums of size n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become 0.

In one operation, you can select a subarray [i, j] (where 0 <= i <= j < n) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,2]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Select the subarray [1,1] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Select subarray [1,3] (which is [1,2,1]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 1. Setting all occurrences of 1 to 0 results in [3,0,2,0].
Select subarray [2,2] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [3,0,0,0].
Select subarray [0,0] (which is [3]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 3. Setting all occurrences of 3 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 3.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

Select subarray [0,5] (which is [1,2,1,2,1,2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 1. Setting all occurrences of 1 to 0 results in [0,2,0,2,0,2].
Select subarray [1,1] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0,0,2,0,2].
Select subarray [3,3] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0,0,2].
Select subarray [5,5] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0,0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Code : //O(n)

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(); // acts like a monotonic stack
        int result = 0; // operation counter

        for (int num : nums) {
            // Maintain a non-decreasing stack
            while (!list.isEmpty() && list.get(list.size() - 1) > num) {
                list.remove(list.size() - 1); // drop larger elements (since values dropped to smaller)
            }

            if (num == 0) continue; // skip zeros, they reset segments

            // If this value introduces a new “height” (layer)
            if (list.isEmpty() || list.get(list.size() - 1) < num) {
                result++;        // need one more operation for this new layer
                list.add(num);     // push it into the monotonic stack
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
