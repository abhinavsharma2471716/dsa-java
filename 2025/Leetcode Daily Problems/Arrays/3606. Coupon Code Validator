You are given three arrays of length n that describe the properties of n coupons: code, businessLine, and isActive. The ith coupon has:

code[i]: a string representing the coupon identifier.
businessLine[i]: a string denoting the business category of the coupon.
isActive[i]: a boolean indicating whether the coupon is currently active.
A coupon is considered valid if all of the following conditions hold:

code[i] is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
businessLine[i] is one of the following four categories: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant".
isActive[i] is true.
Return an array of the codes of all valid coupons, sorted first by their businessLine in the order: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant", and then by code in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.

 

Example 1:

Input: code = ["SAVE20","","PHARMA5","SAVE@20"], businessLine = ["restaurant","grocery","pharmacy","restaurant"], isActive = [true,true,true,true]

Output: ["PHARMA5","SAVE20"]

Explanation:

First coupon is valid.
Second coupon has empty code (invalid).
Third coupon is valid.
Fourth coupon has special character @ (invalid).
Example 2:

Input: code = ["GROCERY15","ELECTRONICS_50","DISCOUNT10"], businessLine = ["grocery","electronics","invalid"], isActive = [false,true,true]

Output: ["ELECTRONICS_50"]

Explanation:

First coupon is inactive (invalid).
Second coupon is valid.
Third coupon has invalid business line (invalid).
 

Constraints:

n == code.length == businessLine.length == isActive.length
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= code[i].length, businessLine[i].length <= 100
code[i] and businessLine[i] consist of printable ASCII characters.
isActive[i] is either true or false.

Code:
//Let n = code.length and k = number of valid coupons.
Validation loop:

Runs once for each coupon → O(n)
matches("[a-zA-Z0-9_]+") is linear in code length, but coupon codes are typically small, so treated as O(1).

Sorting valid coupons:

Sorting k elements → O(k log k)
Comparator work is constant time.

Result collection:
Iterates over k coupons → O(k)

✅ Overall Time Complexity:
O(n+klogk)​
Worst case (all coupons valid): O(n log n)
Best case (no valid coupons): O(n)
