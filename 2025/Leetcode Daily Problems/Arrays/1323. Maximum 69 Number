You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: 
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.
The maximum number is 9969.
Example 2:

Input: num = 9996
Output: 9999
Explanation: Changing the last digit 6 to 9 results in the maximum number.
Example 3:

Input: num = 9999
Output: 9999
Explanation: It is better not to apply any change.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 104
num consists of only 6 and 9 digits.

Code :

Approach 1:

class Solution {
    public int maximum69Number(int num) {
        StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(num));
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '6') {
                s.setCharAt(i, '9'); 
                break;
            }
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(s.toString());
    }
}



Appproach 2:

class Solution {
    public int maximum69Number(int num) {
        String s = String.valueOf(num);
        s = s.replaceFirst("6", "9");
        return Integer.parseInt(s);
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------

Time Complexity:

String.valueOf(num)
Converts the integer into a string.
If the number has d digits, this takes O(d) time.

s.replaceFirst("6", "9")
Scans the string until the first '6' is found, and creates a new string.
Worst case: the last digit is '6' (or no '6' at all), so the method scans the whole string.
→ O(d) time.

Integer.parseInt(s)
Parses the string back into an integer. Again, depends on number of digits.
→ O(d) time.

Total Time Complexity:
O(d)+O(d)+O(d)=O(3d)=O(d)

Where d = number of digits in num.
Since num is at most a 4-digit number in this LeetCode problem (1 <= num <= 10^4),
d ≤ 5, so effectively O(1) constant time in practice.
