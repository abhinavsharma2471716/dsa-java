You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
All the split words are put into a box.
Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2

Output: "dbc"

Explanation: 

All possible splits are:

"d" and "bca".
"db" and "ca".
"dbc" and "a".
Example 2:

Input: word = "gggg", numFriends = 4

Output: "g"

Explanation: 

The only possible split is: "g", "g", "g", and "g".

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 5 * 103
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= numFriends <= word.length

Code :

Approach 1: Enumeration 

Let n be the length of the string word.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

We need to enumerate all substrings that meet the problemâ€™s conditions. Since there are up to n possible starting indices and for each we may extract a substring of up to O(n) length, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

class Solution {

    public String answerString(String word, int numFriends) {
        if (numFriends == 1) {
            return word;
        }
        int n = word.length();
        String res = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String s = word.substring(i, Math.min(i + n - numFriends + 1, n));
            if (res.compareTo(s) <= 0) {
                res = s;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}


Approach 2: Two Pointers

Let n be the length of the string word.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The two pointers together traverse at most n characters. Each character is compared only a constant number of times, so the overall time complexity is linear.

class Solution {

    public String lastSubstring(String s) {
        int i = 0, j = 1, n = s.length();
        while (j < n) {
            int k = 0;
            while (j + k < n && s.charAt(i + k) == s.charAt(j + k)) {
                k++;
            }
            if (j + k < n && s.charAt(i + k) < s.charAt(j + k)) {
                int t = i;
                i = j;
                j = Math.max(j + 1, t + k + 1);
            } else {
                j = j + k + 1;
            }
        }
        return s.substring(i);
    }

    public String answerString(String word, int numFriends) {
        if (numFriends == 1) {
            return word;
        }
        String last = lastSubstring(word);
        int n = word.length(), m = last.length();
        return last.substring(0, Math.min(m, n - numFriends + 1));
    }
}
