Given two positive integers num1 and num2, find the positive integer x such that:

x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
The value x XOR num1 is minimal.
Note that XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the integer x. The test cases are generated such that x is uniquely determined.

The number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.

Code :

class Solution {
    public int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        // Initialize result to num1. We will modify result.
        int result = num1;
        int targetSetBitsCount = Integer.bitCount(num2);
        int setBitsCount = Integer.bitCount(result);
        // Start with the least significant bit (bit 0).
        int currentBit = 0;
        // Add bits to result if it has fewer set bits than the target.
        while (setBitsCount < targetSetBitsCount) {
            // If the current bit in result is not set (0), set it to 1.
            if (!isSet(result, currentBit)) {
                result = setBit(result, currentBit);
                setBitsCount++;
            }
            // Move to the next bit.
            currentBit++;
        }
        // Remove bits from result if it has more set bits than the target.
        while (setBitsCount > targetSetBitsCount) {
            // If the current bit in result is set (1), unset it (make it 0).
            if (isSet(result, currentBit)) {
                result = unsetBit(result, currentBit);
                setBitsCount--;
            }
            // Move to the next bit.
            currentBit++;
        }
        return result;
    }
    // Helper function to check if the given bit position in result is set (1).
    private boolean isSet(int x, int bit) {
        return (x & (1 << bit)) != 0;
    }
    // Helper function to set the given bit position in result to 1.
    private int setBit(int x, int bit) {
        return x | (1 << bit);
    }
    // Helper function to unset the given bit position in x (set it to 0).
    private int unsetBit(int x, int bit) {
        return x & ~(1 << bit);
    }
}
