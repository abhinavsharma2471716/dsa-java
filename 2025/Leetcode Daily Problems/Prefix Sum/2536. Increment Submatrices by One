You are given a positive integer n, indicating that we initially have an n x n 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.

You are also given a 2D integer array query. For each query[i] = [row1i, col1i, row2i, col2i], you should do the following operation:

Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1i, col1i) and the bottom right corner (row2i, col2i). That is, add 1 to mat[x][y] for all row1i <= x <= row2i and col1i <= y <= col2i.
Return the matrix mat after performing every query.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
- In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
- In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
Example 2:


Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after the first query.
- In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 500
1 <= queries.length <= 10^4
0 <= row1i <= row2i < n
0 <= col1i <= col2i < n


Code :

Approach 1 : O(q * n^2)

class Solution {
    public void helper(int sr, int sc, int er, int ec, int[][] matrix){
        for(int i= sr; i<= er;i++){
            for(int j = sc;j <= ec;j++ ){
                matrix[i][j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    public int[][] rangeAddQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[][] matrix = new int[n][n];
        for(int[] query : queries){
            helper(query[0], query[1], query[2], query[3], matrix);
        }
    return matrix;
    }
}

Approach 2 : O(q+ n^2)

class Solution {
    public int[][] rangeAddQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[][] diff = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] q : queries) {
            int r1 = q[0], c1 = q[1], r2 = q[2], c2 = q[3];
            diff[r1][c1] += 1;
            if (c2 + 1 < n) diff[r1][c2 + 1] -= 1;
            if (r2 + 1 < n) diff[r2 + 1][c1] -= 1;
            if (r2 + 1 < n && c2 + 1 < n) diff[r2 + 1][c2 + 1] += 1;
        }
        int[][] ans = new int[n][n];
       // Build prefix sum row-wise
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int curr = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                curr += diff[i][j];
                ans[i][j] = curr;
            }
        }
        // Build prefix sum column-wise
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int curr = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                curr += ans[i][j];
                ans[i][j] = curr;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
