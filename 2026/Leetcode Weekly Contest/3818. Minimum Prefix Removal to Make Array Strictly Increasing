You are given an integer array nums.

You need to remove exactly one prefix (possibly empty) from nums.

Return an integer denoting the minimum length of the removed prefix such that the remaining array is strictly increasing.

A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

An array is said to be strictly increasing if each element is strictly greater than its previous one (if exists).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,-1,2,3,3,4,5]

Output: 4

Explanation:

Removing the prefix = [1, -1, 2, 3] leaves the remaining array [3, 4, 5] which is strictly increasing.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,3,-2,-5]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Removing the prefix = [4, 3, -2] leaves the remaining array [-5] which is strictly increasing.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 0

Explanation:

The array nums = [1, 2, 3, 4] is already strictly increasing so removing an empty prefix is sufficient.

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Code : //O(n)


class Solution {
    public int minimumPrefixLength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        // The last element of the array
        // A single element is always strictly increasing
        int nextElement = nums[n - 1];
        // Traverse from right to left
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            // If current element is not strictly smaller than the next one,
            // the suffix starting at i is not strictly increasing
            if (nums[i] >= nextElement) {
                // We must remove prefix [0 ... i]
                return i + 1;
            }
            // Update the expected next element for strict increase
            nextElement = nums[i];
        }
        // Entire array is already strictly increasing
        return 0;
    }
}
