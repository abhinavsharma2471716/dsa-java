You are given an integer n.

An integer is called Monobit if all bits in its binary representation are the same.

Return the count of Monobit integers in the range [0, n] (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 1] have binary representations "0" and "1".
Each representation consists of identical bits. Thus, the answer is 2.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 4] include binaries "0", "1", "10", "11", and "100".
Only 0, 1 and 3 satisfy the Monobit condition. Thus, the answer is 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 1000

Code: 

Approach 1 : //O(n)

class Solution {
    public int countMonobit(int n) {
        int count = 1;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            String s = Integer.toBinaryString(i);
            if(s.length() == Integer.bitCount(i)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}


Approach 2: //O(logn)

class Solution {
    public int countMonobit(int n) {
        int count = 1; // counting 0
        int num = 1;

        while (num <= n) {
            count++;
            num = (num << 1) | 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
