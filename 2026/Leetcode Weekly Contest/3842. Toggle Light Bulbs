You are given an array bulbs of integers between 1 and 100.

There are 100 light bulbs numbered from 1 to 100. All of them are switched off initially.

For each element bulbs[i] in the array bulbs:

If the bulbs[i]th light bulb is currently off, switch it on.
Otherwise, switch it off.
Return the list of integers denoting the light bulbs that are on in the end, sorted in ascending order. If no bulb is on, return an empty list.

 

Example 1:

Input: bulbs = [10,30,20,10]

Output: [20,30]

Explanation:

The bulbs[0] = 10th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[1] = 30th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[2] = 20th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[3] = 10th light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
In the end, the 20th and the 30th light bulbs are on.
Example 2:

Input: bulbs = [100,100]

Output: []

Explanation:

The bulbs[0] = 100th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[1] = 100th light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
In the end, no light bulb is on.
 

Constraints:

1 <= bulbs.length <= 100
1 <= bulbs[i] <= 100

Code:

Approach 1 : // o(nlogn)


class Solution {
    public List<Integer> toggleLightBulbs(List<Integer> bulbs) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Collections.sort(bulbs);
        for(int i=0;i<bulbs.size();i++){
            if(!result.isEmpty() && result.get(result.size() - 1) == bulbs.get(i)){
                result.remove(result.size() - 1);
            }else{
                result.add(bulbs.get(i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Appraoch 2: // o(n + klogk)

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> toggleLightBulbs(List<Integer> bulbs) {
         Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int bulb : bulbs) {
            if (set.contains(bulb)) {
                set.remove(bulb);  // toggle OFF
            } else {
                set.add(bulb);     // toggle ON
            }
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(set);
        Collections.sort(result);
        
        return result;
    }
}

Appraoch 3 : //O(n)

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> toggleLightBulbs(List<Integer> bulbs) {
        // Boolean array to track the state of bulbs (1 to 100)
        // false = OFF (default), true = ON
        boolean[] isOn = new boolean[101];

        // Toggle the state of each bulb mentioned in the input list
        for (int bulbNumber : bulbs) {
            isOn[bulbNumber] = !isOn[bulbNumber];
        }

        // Prepare the result list to store bulbs that remain ON
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Collect all bulbs that are ON after toggling
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (isOn[i]) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
