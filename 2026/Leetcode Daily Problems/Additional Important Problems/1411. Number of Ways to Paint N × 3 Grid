You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000

Code: //O(n)

class Solution {
    public int numOfWays(int n) {
        long MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        /*
         * a → number of ways where current row is of type "ABC"
         *      (all three cells have different colors)
         *      Example: R Y G, G R Y, Y G R
         *
         * b → number of ways where current row is of type "ABA"
         *      (first and third cells same, middle different)
         *      Example: R Y R, G R G, Y G Y
         */

        // Base case: for the first row
        long a = 6; // ABC patterns
        long b = 6; // ABA patterns

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {

            /*
             * Transitions:
             *
             * New ABC row can be formed from:
             *  - previous ABC row in 2 ways
             *  - previous ABA row in 2 ways
             */
            long newA = (2 * a + 2 * b) % MOD;

            /*
             * New ABA row can be formed from:
             *  - previous ABC row in 2 ways
             *  - previous ABA row in 3 ways
             */
            long newB = (2 * a + 3 * b) % MOD;

            a = newA;
            b = newB;
        }

        // Total ways = ABC + ABA patterns for last row
        return (int) ((a + b) % MOD);
    }
}
